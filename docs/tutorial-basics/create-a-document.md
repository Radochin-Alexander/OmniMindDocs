# Project

A Project is a customizable form of interaction between the user and OmniMind entities, where specific information is processed. Each Project can be responsible for different types of information, their processing, and the visualization of answers. There is no limit to the number of Projects you can create. 
Projects can be given names, added to Favorites, invite other users to your Projects, assign different interaction rights to different users, set passwords for Projects, add allowed domain types, embed Projects in external resources, and obtain an external link to a specific Project.

> To create your first Project, you need to choose a suitable **pricing plan**.
