# Processor

After selecting the type of Informer, configuring its settings, and uploading the resource, processing is performed by the Processor.

The Processor is an entity that processes the information uploaded through the Informer by breaking it into blocks and saving it in a database in a special format (vectors). It allows for the analysis and transformation of data using the algorithms you have chosen and forms a knowledge base.
The Processor can be based on various technologies, such as OpenAI and other artificial intelligence technologies.
