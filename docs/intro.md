# Welcome to the OmniMind!

Let's discover **OmniMind**.

## What is OmniMind

**OmniMind** is a SaaS platform that enables the use of your own information and data from various sources to find answers using artificial intelligence (AI). It offers flexible customization of AI, including tools like OpenAI and ChatGPT, using your data and knowledge base.

The **main function** of OmniMind is to provide AI-powered solutions for specific tasks. The system allows you to build an ETL (Extraction, Transformation, and Loading) information cycle for data processing and further utilization in AI systems.

The process of the system's operation is as follows:

- You specify the sources from which to retrieve information or directly upload documents;
- OmniMind saves and processes the data using the AI algorithms you have chosen, forming a knowledge base.
